# Anything-3D Final Project
This is a fork of the [Anything 3D](https://github.com/Anything-of-anything/Anything-3D/tree/main/AnyObject3D) project for our [Deeprob](https://deeprob.org/w24/) final project. The project allows 3d reconstruction and novel view synthesis from a single monocular image. 

In this repository, we included extra setup instructions and slight modifications for easy running. We also implemented a code extension where we test the performance of the project using alternative segmentation models in addition to using [GPT-4](https://openai.com/gpt-4) for creating text prompts instead of [BLIP](https://github.com/salesforce/BLIP).

# Project Code
Our project code resides in [this directory](https://github.com/averyyyyyy/Anything-3D/tree/main/AnyObject3D) along with installation instructions. To run this code, you need a [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) capable machine. We suggest having at least 16GB of vram on GPU.
